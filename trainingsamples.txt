hes awake and listening to us said the old woman sly little rascal 
she chuckled but royalty has need of slyness and if hes really the 
kwisatz haderach  well 
within the shadows of his bed paul held his eyes open to mere slits two 
bird bright ovals  the eyes of the old woman  seemed to expand and glow 
as they stared into his 
sleep well you sly little rascal said the old woman tomorrow youl 
need all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar 
and she was gone pushing his mother out closing the door with a solid 
thump 
paul lay awake wondering whats a gom jabbar 
in all the upset during this time of change the old woman was the strangest 
thing he had seen 
paul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed  thinking  thinking 
this world of castle caladan without play or companions his own age 
perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell dr yueh his teacher had hinted 
that the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on arrakis the 
planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to 
command them will o the sand people called fremen marked down on no 
census of the imperial regate 
when we slip into the villages and towns we must mask our origin blend 
with the pan and graben folk stilgar said we carry no weapons for the 
crysknife is sacred but you woman you have the weirding ability of battle 
wed only heard of it and many doubted but one cannot doubt what he sees 
with his own eyes you mastered an armed fremen this is a weapon no 
search could expose 
feyd rauthas attention went to a bloody scratch on the mans left 
forearm followed the arm down to the hand as it pointed to a design drawn in 
blood on the left hip of the green leotards  a wet shape there the formalized 
outline of a hawk 
hawk 
feyd rautha looked up into the darkly pitted eyes saw them glaring at him 
with uncommon alertness 
its one of duke letos fighting men we took on arrakis feyd rautha 
thought no simple gladiator this a chill ran through him and he wondered 
if hawat had another plan for this arena  a feint within a feint within a feint 
and only the slavemaster prepared to take the blame 
feyd rauthas chief handler spoke at his ear i like not the look on that 
one mlord let me set a barb or two in his knife arm to try him 
pii set my own barbs feyd rautha said he took a pair of the long 
hooked shafts from the handler hefted them testing the balance these barbs 
too were supposed to be drugged  but not this time and the chief handler 
might die because of that but it was all part of the plan 
his feint and defensive counter were as good as any feyd rautha had ever 
seen a timed side blow missed by the barest fraction from severing the 
tendons of the na barons left leg 
feyd rautha danced away leaving a barbed shaft in the slaves right 
forearm the hooks completely buried in flesh where the man could not 
withdraw thim without ripping tendons 
a concerted gasp lifted from the galleries 
the sound filled feyd rautha with elation 
he knew now what his uncle was experiencing sitting up there with the 
fenrings the observers from the imperial court beside him there could be 
no interference with this fight the forms must be observed in front of 
witnesses and the baron would interpret the events in the arena only one 
way  threat to himself 
she heard the hidden meaning in his words realized he had detected the 
poison in the original unchanged substance that he was concerned for her it 
occurred to jessica then to wonder about the limits of pauls prescience his 
question revealed much to her 
you may drink it she said it has been changed and she looked 
beyond him to see stilgar staring down at her the dark dark eyes studying 
now we know you cannot be false he said 
she sensed hidden meaning here too but the muzziness of the drug was 
overpowering her senses how warm it was and soothing how beneficent 
these fremen to bring her into the fold of such companionship 
no woman no man no child ever was deeply intimate with 
my father the closest anyone ever came to casual cameraderie 
with the padishah emperor was the relationship offered by 
count hasimir fenring a companion from childhood the 
measure of count fenrings friendship may be seen first in a 
positive thing he allayed the landraads suspicions after the 
arrakis affair it cost more than a billion solaris in spice 
bribes so my mother said and there were other gifts as well 
slave women royal honors and tokens of rank the second 
major evidence of the counts friendship was negative he 
refused to kill a man even though it was within his capabilities 
and my father commanded it i will relate this presently 
the baron whirled stared at feyd rautha standing in the doorway the 
presence of his nephew here now  the look of hurry that the young man 
no one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that 
this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than mans and yet as mortal 
as his own that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied 
perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and 
multiply in a drop of water with infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their 
little affairs serene in their assurance of their empire over matter it is possible that the infusoria 
under the microscope do the same no one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human 
danger or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable it is curious to 
recall some of the mental habits of those departed days at most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon 
mars perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise yet across the gulf of space minds 
that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish intellects vast and cool 
and unsympathetic regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us 
and early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment
the planet mars i scarcely need remind the reader revolves about the sun at a mean distance of 
140000000 miles and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world it 
must be if the nebular hypothesis has any truth older than our world and long before this earth ceased to be molten 
life upon its surface must have begun its course the fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must
have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at which life could begin it has air and water and all that is 
necessary for the support of animated existence
yet so vain is man and so blinded by his vanity that no writer up to the very end of the nineteenth century 
expressed any idea that intelligent life might have developed there far or indeed at all beyond its earthly level 
nor was it generally understood that since mars is older than our earth with scarcely a quarter of the superficial area
and remoter from the sun it necessarily follows that it is not only more distant from times beginning but nearer its end
the secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already gone far indeed with our neighbour its physical 
condition is still largely a mystery but we know now that even in its equatorial region the midday temperature 
barely approaches that of our coldest winter its air is much more attenuated than ours its oceans have shrunk 
until they cover but a third of its surface and as its slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about 
either pole and periodically inundate its temperate zones that last stage of exhaustion which 
to us is still incredibly remote has become a present day problem for the inhabitants of mars the 
immediate pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects enlarged their powers and hardened their 
hearts and looking across space with instruments and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of 
they see at its nearest distance only 35000000 of miles sunward of them a morning star of hope our own 
warmer planet green with vegetation and grey with water with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility with 
glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow navy crowded seas
and we men the creatures who inhabit this earth must be to them at least as alien and lowly as are 
the monkeys and lemurs to us the intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant 
struggle for existence and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon mars their world is 
far gone in its cooling and this world is still crowded with life but crowded only with what they regard as inferior 
animals to carry warfare sunward is indeed their only escape from the destruction that generation after generation 
creeps upon them
i began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that ogilvy had told me of the 
impossibility of the martians establishing themselves on the earth in particular i laid stress on the 
gravitational difficulty on the surface of the earth the force of gravity is three times what it is on the surface of mars a martian 
therefore would weigh three times more than on mars albeit his muscular strength would be the same his own body would be a cope of lead to 
him that indeed was the general opinion both the times and the daily telegraph for instance insisted on it the next morning and both overlooked 
just as i did two obvious modifying influences
the atmosphere of the earth we now know contains far more oxygen or far less argon whichever way one likes to put it than does mars 
the invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the martians indisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their bodies and in 
the second place we all overlooked the fact that such mechanical intelligence as the martian possessed was quite able to dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch
at first i regarded little but the road before me and then abruptly my attention was arrested by something that was moving rapidly down the opposite slope 
of maybury hill at first i took it for the wet roof of a house but one flash following another showed it to be in swift rolling movement it was 
an elusive vision a moment of bewildering darkness and then in a flash like daylight the red masses of the orphanage near the crest of the hill 
the green tops of the pine trees and this problematical object came out clear and sharp and bright
and this thing i saw how can i describe it a monstrous tripod higher than many houses striding over the young pine trees and smashing them aside in its career 
a walking engine of glittering metal striding now across the heather articulate ropes of steel dangling from it and the clattering tumult of its passage mingling with 
the riot of the thunder a flash and it came out vividly heeling over one way with two feet in the air to vanish and reappear almost instantly as it seemed with the next 
flash a hundred yards nearer can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently along the ground that was the impression those instant flashes gave but instead of a 
milking stool imagine it a great body of machinery on a tripod stand
then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted as brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them they were 
snapped off and driven headlong and a second huge 
tripod appeared rushing as it seemed headlong 
towards me and i was galloping hard to meet it 
at the sight of the second monster my nerve went altogether 
not stopping to look again i wrenched the horses head hard round to 
the right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled over upon the horse 
the shafts smashed noisily and i was flung sideways and 
fell heavily into a shallow pool of water
later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and 
became the first of the fighting machines i had seen the gun he drove had been unlimbered 
near horsell in order to command the sand pits and its arrival it was that had precipitated the action as the limber gunners went to the rear 
his horse trod in a rabbit hole and came down throwing him into a depression of the ground at the same moment the gun exploded behind him the 
ammunition blew up there was fire all about him and he found himself lying under a heap of charred dead men and dead horses
i lay still he said scared out of my wits with the fore quarter of a horse atop of me wed been wiped out 
and the smell  good god like burnt meat i was hurt across the back by the fall of the horse and there i had to 
lie until i felt better just like parade it had been a minute before then stumble bang swish
wiped out he said
he had hid under the dead horse for a long time peeping out furtively across the 
common the cardigan men had tried a rush in skirmishing order at the pit simply to be swept out of 
existence then the monster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely to and fro across the common among the few fugitives 
with its headlike hood turning about exactly like the head of a cowled human being a kind of arm carried a complicated metallic case about
