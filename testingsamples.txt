could not quite conceal  all revealed much feyd rautha had his own spy 
system focused on the baron 
there is a body in my chambers that i wish removed the baron said and 
he kept his hand at the projectile weapon beneath his robes thankful that his 
shield was the best 
feyd rautha glanced at two guardsmen against the right wall nodded the 
two detached themselves scurried out the door and down the hall toward the 
barons apartments 
those two eh the baron thought ah this young monster has much to 
learn yet about conspiracy 
i presume you left matters peaceful in the slave quarters feyd the baron 
gurney was born a death commando paul said and he thought yes let 
them occupy their minds with small talk before we test ourselves against that 
force on the plain he looked to the gap in the rock wall and back to gurney 
found that the troubadour warrior had resumed a brooding scowl 
it seemed that a full second passed before they felt the ground beneath 
them ripple and shake a rumbling sound was added to the storms roar 
the fedaykin watcher from the telescope appeared beside paul the 
telescope clutched under one arm the shield wall is breached muad dib 
he shouted the storm is on them and our gunners already are firing 
which green flashes scintillated and out of the funnel of this there smoked the heat ray
in a few minutes there was so far as the soldier could see not a living 
thing left upon the common and every bush and tree upon it that was not already a blackened skeleton was burning the hussars had been on the road beyond the curvature of the ground and he saw nothing of them he heard 
the martians rattle for a time and then become still the giant saved woking station and its cluster of houses until the last then in a moment the heat ray was brought to bear and the town became a heap of fiery ruins 
then the thing shut off the heat ray and turning its back upon the artilleryman began to waddle away towards the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the second cylinder 
as it did so a second glittering titan built itself up out of the pit
the second monster followed the first and at that the artilleryman began to crawl very 
cautiously across the hot heather ash towards horsell he managed to get alive into the ditch by the side of the road and so escaped to woking 
there his story became ejaculatory the place was impassable it seems there were a few people alive there frantic for the most part and many burned and scalded he was 
turned aside by the fire and hid among some almost scorching heaps of broken wall as one of the martian giants returned he saw this one pursue a man catch him up in one of its steely 
tentacles and knock his head against the trunk of a pine tree at last after nightfall the artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway embankment
several farm waggons and carts were moving creakily along the road to addlestone and 
suddenly through the gate of a field we saw across a stretch of flat meadow six twelve pounders 
standing neatly at equal distances pointing towards woking the gunners stood by the guns waiting and 
the ammunition waggons were at a business like distance the men stood almost as if under inspection
farther on towards weybridge just over the bridge there were a number of men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart and more guns behind
its bows and arrows against the lightning anyhow said the artilleryman they avent seen that fire beam yet
byfleet was in a tumult people packing and a score of hussars some of 
them dismounted some on horseback were hunting them about three or four black government 
waggons with crosses in white circles
